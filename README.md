# Connect 4 AI with Minimax Algorithm

# Description:

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The program features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the customtkinter library. Players can challenge an AI that intelligently selects moves to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

# Features:

- Graphical Interface: User-friendly GUI built with customtkinter.

- AI Opponent: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make strategic decisions.

- Scoring System: Tracks scores for both the player and the AI across games.

- Interactive Gameplay: Click to drop pieces, reset the board, and start new games.

- Dynamic Turn Notifications: Displays whose turn it is during gameplay.

# How It Works:

- The player and AI take turns dropping pieces into a 7x6 grid.

- The first to align four pieces in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

- The AI evaluates moves using the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible outcome.
